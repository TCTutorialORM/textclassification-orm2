# Replace the item list tag (e.g.<li> and </li>) with a newline
# character encoded as "\n". This is done using the
# gsub() function. This function accepts a text pattern as one of
# its argument and replaces all text that match that pattern.
# Here the text pattern is "</?[Ll][Ii]>" and it matches <LI>,
# </LI>, <li>, and </li>. The pattern is also called a
# "regular expression". The variable htmlfile now contains the
# processed text.

# is in the div tag with class "content". Note that this might be different

# you should provide the appropriate value for the path argument
